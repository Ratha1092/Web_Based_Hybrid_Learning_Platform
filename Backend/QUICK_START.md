# 🚀 Instructor Verification System - Quick Start

## What Was Just Built

You now have a complete **instructor verification system** where:

1. ✅ New instructors register and submit evidence
2. ✅ Admins review and approve/reject applications  
3. ✅ Only verified instructors can create courses
4. ✅ Instructors see their verification status on dashboard

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Required to Activate)

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This creates:
- `instructor_verifications` table
- Updates to `users` table

### Step 2: Link Storage (for file uploads)
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This makes uploaded files publicly accessible.

### Step 3: Clear Cache (Optional)
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan filament:clear-cache
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test 1: Register as Instructor
1. Go to http://localhost:8000/register
2. Select "Instructor" role
3. Fill in name, email, password
4. Fill instructor form with:
   - Bio: "5+ years teaching Python"
   - Experience: "Taught 100+ students"
   - Qualification: "Professional Certification"
   - Institution: "Your Organization"
   - Year: "2023"
5. Upload sample PDFs for certificate and ID
6. Submit

**Expected**: Redirected to instructor dashboard with "⏳ Verification Pending" alert

### Test 2: Admin Review (Filament)
1. Go to `/admin/dashboard` (if Filament is configured)
2. Find "User Management" → "Instructor Verifications"
3. Click on the pending application
4. Review the details and documents
5. Click "Approve" button
6. Confirm

**Expected**: 
- Application status changes to "Approved"

### Test 3: Verify Dashboard Update
1. Login as the newly verified instructor
2. Go to instructor dashboard
3. Should see "✓ Verified Instructor" alert

## 🔐 Protecting Course Creation (Optional)

To prevent unverified instructors from creating courses, update your course routes:

**In `routes/web.php`:**
```php
Route::middleware(['is_instructor', 'verified_instructor'])
    ->group(function () {
        Route::post('/instructor/courses', [CourseController::class, 'store'])
            ->name('courses.store');
        // ... other course routes
    });
```

The `verified_instructor` middleware will redirect unverified instructors with an error message.

'qualification_type' => 'nullable|in:degree,certification,professional_experience'
```

### Change File Upload Limits
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/Web/AuthController.php` (in validation)
```php
'certificate_file' => 'nullable|file|mimes:pdf,jpg,jpeg,png|max:5120', // 5MB

### Change Status Messages
**File**: `resources/views/instructor/dashboard.blade.php`

Search for the alert sections and modify text.

### Add Email Notifications
